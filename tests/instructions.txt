In order to run the test files, you must have pytest installed and you must be in the iip/ directory (for now, until the testing files are moved)

Downloading and Installing pytest:
1. Download pytest  (ie. pip install -U pytest )
2. Run py.test --version to see if it works
3. You will need to edit the functions in the JobScoreboard.py to return True or False. Look the attached file for information regarding that.
4. In the iip/ directory run "py.test -v tests/name_of_file"  
(ie). "py.test -v tests/test_ack_sb.py" or "py.test -v" (to run all test files)
5. v is for verbose and -s shows stdout messages
